## Project Description

This is a console-based Java application designed to manage student training and examination records. It provides two main sections: a **Student Section** for students to register, select a course, and take an exam, and an **Admin Section** for administrators to view all registered students and their exam results.

The system uses a simple text file (`students.txt`) for persistent data storage, allowing student records and scores to be saved and loaded between application runs.

## Features

### Student Section:
* **Student Registration/Login:** Students can enter their name and email. If the email already exists, the system recognizes them; otherwise, a new student record is created.
* **Course Selection:** Students can choose between "Java" and "Python" courses (though the current exam questions are generic and apply to both).
* **Take Exam:** A short, predefined multiple-choice/short-answer exam is presented.
* **Score Calculation:** The system calculates and displays the student's score.
* **Pass/Fail Status:** Determines if the student passed or failed based on a simple pass mark (score >= 50% of total questions).
* **Score Persistence:** Student scores are updated and saved to `students.txt`.

### Admin Section:
* **Admin Login:** Requires a hardcoded password (`admin123`) to access.
* **View All Students:** Displays a formatted list of all registered students, including their name, email, chosen course, and latest exam score.

### Data Management:
* **File-based Storage:** All student data is stored in `students.txt` in a comma-separated format.
* **Automatic File Creation:** The `students.txt` file is automatically created if it doesn't exist upon application startup.
* **Data Parsing:** Handles reading and writing student records from/to the file, including updating existing records.

## How It's Working (Architecture & Logic)

The system is structured into several Java classes, each responsible for a specific part of the application's functionality:

* **`Assignment.java` (Main Class):**
    * This is the entry point of the application.
    * It presents the main menu (Student Section, Admin Section, Exit).
    * It handles user input for menu navigation.
    * It orchestrates the flow between the student and admin functionalities.
    * Manages the `Scanner` for console input and the `FileManager` for data persistence.

* **`Student.java`:**
    * Represents a student entity with properties like `name`, `email`, `course`, and `score`.
    * Provides getters and setters for these properties.
    * Includes `toString()` method to convert a `Student` object into a comma-separated string for file storage.
    * Includes a static `fromFileString()` method to parse a string from the file back into a `Student` object.

* **`Admin.java`:**
    * Handles admin-specific operations.
    * Contains a `login()` method with a hardcoded password for demonstration.
    * Provides `viewStudents()` functionality, which reads student data using `FileManager` and displays it in a formatted table.

* **`Exam.java`:**
    * Manages the exam logic.
    * Stores a predefined set of questions and their correct answers.
    * `startExam()` method presents questions to the student and calculates their score based on correct answers.

* **`FileManager.java`:**
    * Responsible for all file I/O operations related to `students.txt`.
    * `createFileIfNotExist()`: Ensures the data file exists, creating it if it doesn't.
    * `readStudents()`: Reads all student records from the file and returns them as a `List<Student>`. It includes basic error handling for malformed lines.
    * `writeStudent()`: Appends a new student's data to the file.
    * `updateStudent()`: Reads all students, finds and updates a specific student's record (identified by email), and then rewrites the entire file. This ensures data consistency after an exam.

## Setup and Running the Project

To compile and run this project, you will need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

1.  **Clone the Repository (or download the files):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    ```
    (Replace with your actual GitHub URL)

    Or, if you already have the files, just navigate to your project directory:
    ```bash
    cd C:\Users\neha1\OneDrive\Desktop\java question\bootcamp\student_management_system
    ```
    (Adjust path as necessary)

2.  **Compile the Java Source Files:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and compile all `.java` files:
    ```bash
    javac *.java
    ```
    This command will generate `.class` files for each Java source file.

3.  **Run the Application:**
    Execute the `Assignment` class, which contains the `main` method:
    ```bash
    java Assignment
    ```

4.  **Interact with the Console:**
    Follow the prompts in the console to navigate through the Student and Admin sections.

### Admin Password:
The default admin password is `admin123`.

## Future Enhancements (Optional Section - good for showing thought)

* **More Robust Input Validation:** Implement stricter checks for email format, numerical inputs, etc.
* **User Authentication (Hashing Passwords):** Instead of a hardcoded admin password, implement secure password hashing.
* **Dynamic Exam Questions:** Load questions from a file or database, allowing for different exams per course.
* **Different Exam Types:** Implement multiple-choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blanks.
* **Student Deletion/Modification (Admin):** Add functionality for admins to remove or edit student records.
* **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Convert the console application to a desktop application using Swing or JavaFX.
* **Database Integration:** Replace file-based storage with a relational database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL) for better scalability and data management.
